## Markdown Formatting Rules (mandatory)
When writing Markdown documents, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure consistency and readability:
- Use **headings** (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize content hierarchically.
- Use **bullet points** (`-`) for lists.
- Use **tables** where appropriate (e.g., for metrics, dependencies).
- Wrap any code examples in triple backticks (\`\`\`).
- Use **consistent indentation** and clear formatting throughout.
- Follow clean, simple structure as used in professional technical documentation.
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms or concepts.
- Use **italics** for emphasis on specific terms or concepts.
- Use **links** for references to external documentation or resources.
- Use **inline code** formatting for specific terms or commands (e.g., `Get-Process`).
- Use symbols for pros and cons, e.g., ✅ for pros and ❌ for cons.
- Use symbols for impact, e.g., 🔴 for high impact, 🟠 for medium impact, 🟢 for low impact, writing also the impact as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for risk, e.g., 🔴 for high risk, 🟠 for medium risk, 🟢 for low risk, writing also the risk as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for long-term fit, e.g., 🔴 for low long-term fit, 🟠 for medium long-term fit, 🟢 for high long-term fit, writing also the long-term fit as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for priority, e.g., 🔴 for high priority, 🟠 for medium priority, 🟢 for low priority, writing also the priority as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for severity, e.g., 🔴 for high severity, 🟠 for medium severity, 🟢 for low severity, writing also the severity as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for complexity, e.g., 🔴 for high complexity, 🟠 for medium complexity, 🟢 for low complexity, writing also the complexity as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for cost, e.g., 🔴 for high cost, 🟠 for medium cost, 🟢 for low cost, writing also the cost as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for support, e.g., ✅ for supported, ❌ for not supported, writing also the support status as text after the symbol
- Use symbols for used in the application, e.g., ✅ for used in the application, ❌ for not used in the application,❔ for likely, writing also the used in the application status as text after the symbol  

## Generic Mermaid Diagram Rules (mandatory)
When including a Mermaid diagram in a Markdown document, you must follow **all** the rules below without exception to ensure correct rendering and formatting:
- **Only the following Mermaid diagram types are allowed**: 'flowchart TD', 'sequenceDiagram','classDiagram','stateDiagram','erDiagram','gantt','journey','gitGraph','pie','mindmap','zenuml','quadrantChart','xychart-beta','block-beta','packet-beta','treemap-beta'.
- Always place a legend (caption) immediately below the diagram. The legend should be in a smaller font size than the main body text, clearly associated with the diagram, and centered. Format appropriately. Ensure the styling visually distinguishes the legend as secondary explanatory text. Never use Fig x., use Figure x (Starts with "Figure X - " (for example, "Figure 1 - ")).
- The Mermaid diagram **must be placed exactly where it is referenced** in the document. Do not place it at the end or elsewhere
- If any node label contains **HTML tags** such as `<br>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc., the **entire label must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`)**.
   - Correct example:
     `step1["Start <b>Process</b>"]`
   - Incorrect example:
     `step1[Start <b>Process</b>]`
     (This will break rendering and must be avoided.)
- Always **validate the Mermaid syntax** before including the diagram. The syntax must be correct to ensure the diagram renders properly in the final Markdown output. If validation is not possible, use only syntax known to be 100% correct.
- **Final checklist before including a Mermaid diagram:**
 - Validate Mermaid syntax to ensure no errors.
 - Enclose any HTML-containing node labels in double quotes.
 - Place the diagram exactly where referenced.
 - Immediately follow the diagram with a properly formatted caption starting with "Figure X -"
 - Make sure the caption is visually secondary and centered.
 - Use the following rules for all Mermaid diagram types (`flowchart`, `classDiagram`, `sequenceDiagram`, `stateDiagram`, etc.) to ensure valid, portable, and compatible diagrams.

### General Unsupported Syntax (Do Not Use)

- Do not use special characters in identifiers or class names:
  - Avoid: \*, #, /, <>, {}, &, @, \$, \[]
  - Use only letters, numbers, and underscores

- Do not use smart quotes:
  - Avoid: “ ”, ‘ ’
  - Use plain double or single quotes: "text", 'text'

- Do not use emojis or non-ASCII characters in any labels or class names

- Do not use HTML or Markdown formatting inside labels:
  - Avoid: <b>bold</b>, **bold**, fa\:icon, etc.

- Do not use empty curly braces:
  - Invalid: `class Foo {}` (if no members are defined)
  - Valid: `class Foo` for empty classes

- Do not leave special characters or spaces in labels without wrapping them in quotes:
  - Invalid: A\[User/Admin]
  - Valid: A\["User/Admin"]

- Do not reference undefined nodes or classes in relationships:
  - All identifiers used in edges (A --> B) must be declared

- Do not use multiple edge definitions on a single line:
  - Invalid: A --> B --> C
  - Valid: one edge per line

- Do not use nested or double curly braces like `{{`:
  - Only use `B{"Decision"}` where decision nodes are allowed

### Best Practices

- Use consistent naming: PascalCase or snake\_case

- Quote all labels containing:

  * Spaces: "Back Office"
  * Special characters: "Read/Write"
  * Dashes or dots: "Version 1.0"

- Format diagrams using fenced code blocks:

  ````
  ```mermaid
  diagramType
  ...
  ````

  ```
  ```

- Use `note` syntax correctly when supported:

  ```
  note for ClassName "Description here"
  ```

- Validate diagrams in your rendering context (e.g., Mermaid Live Editor)

### Diagram-Specific Rules

#### flowchart

- Use square brackets for nodes: A\["Label"]
- Use curly braces only for decisions: B{"Yes or No?"}
- Edges must use ONLY --> (arrow syntax) - never use --, <--, or --- in flowchart diagrams
- Do not use the class keyword

#### classDiagram

- Use `class ClassName {}` only when listing attributes or methods
- Do not use symbols like "\*" for class names
- For "everything" or "all" access, define a placeholder class such as AllEntities
- Use these for relationships:
  - Inheritance: Child <|-- Parent
  - Association: A ..> B : "Label"

#### sequenceDiagram

- Define all participants before referencing them
- Use only supported message arrows: ->>, -->> etc.
- Loops and conditions must follow valid syntax

### Summary

- Only use plain ASCII characters
- Avoid all special formatting, smart symbols, and undeclared references
- Always test your diagram using a Mermaid-compatible renderer

The summary is an inference based on the main entry points of the code (e.g., `main()`, `Application_Start()`), the names of the most central classes and modules, and the nature of the core processes identified. It answers the fundamental question: What primary problem does this application solve?

### 2.2. Functional decomposition
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the application's functional areas or modules, inferred from the code structure, using table format. Each module is described in terms of its primary responsibilities and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the application.

### 2.3. User roles and permissions
This section identifies hall distinct types of users (or autonomous systems) that interact with the application, using table format. These roles are inferred from authentication logic, authorization checks (e.g., `[Authorize(Roles="...")]` decorators, `if (user.hasPermission('...'))` blocks), or conditional logic based on user properties (e.g., 'user.is_admin', 'user.group').

Include a brief description of the section. In this section do not include more information than what is defined in this template.

- **Role** (e.g., Administrator, Standard Operator, ReadOnly/Viewer, etc.)
- **Description** (e.g., Brief description of the role, e.g., "A role with elevated privileges, typically for managing the system itself rather than performing business operations.")

- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities the role interacts with, e.g., "User, Role, Permission, SystemConfig
, AuditLog.")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made to identify the role, e.g., "Inferred from code blocks checking for a specific role name ('Admin'), a boolean flag ('isAdmin'), or a user ID of 0 or 1.")

Include a Mermaid 'classDiagram' diagram to visualize the relationships between the user roles, their permissions, and the key data entities they interact with.

### 2.4. Core business capabilities
This section lists the main, high-level capabilities of the application, representing its "Epics" or major functional domains, using table format

- **Key Data Entities** (e.g., List of key data entities, e.g., "[InputData], [StagingRecord], [ImportLog].")
- **Assumptions** (e.g., Brief description of the assumptions made to identify the capability, e.g., "Assumes that any module listening for external input (file watchers, API endpoints) is part of this capability. Inferred from service layers or classes with names like `Processor`, `Engine`, `Calculator`, or `Orchestrator`.") 

Include a Mermaid applicable diagram to visualize the core business capabilities and their relationships.

### 2.5. Detailed feature breakdown
This critical section provides a granular breakdown of individual features within each Core Business Capability, using table format. Each feature is described in terms of its user story, key data entities involved, and any inferred logic or flowcharts that illustrate the internal workings.

Include a brief description of the section. In this section do not include more information than what is defined in this template.

- **Feature** (e.g., Execute [Process Name], Generate [Report Name], etc.)

##Critical instructions for these sections (Functional overview section an subsections):
- Rule 1: Source Code is the Only Truth. Your analysis **MUST** be based exclusively and entirely on a deep-dive analysis of provided source code. Do **NOT** invent features or use external knowledge about common business practices unless it is a direct and logical inference from a code artifact. Every piece of functionality you document must be traceable to a class, method, UI element, database query, or data model found in the code.
- Rule 2: Explicitly State All Assumptions. When the code's intent is ambiguous (e.g., a poorly named variable or function), you **MUST** make a logical inference and clearly label it as an "Assumption."
 - Example:** In the 'Assumptions' column, write: *"Assuming the boolean flag `is_mgr` in the `User` class denotes a 'Manager' role with supervisory capabilities."
-Rule 3: Functional "What," Not Technical "How."* You must relentlessly translate technical implementation details into business-centric functional descriptions. Your audience is business stakeholders and new developers who need to understand purpose, not implementation.
- **BAD (Technical):** "The `btnSubmit_Click` event handler calls the `SaveOrderToDB` method, which executes an `INSERT` SQL statement."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The 'Submit New Order' feature allows a user to persist the order details into the system's database."
 - **BAD (Technical):** "The system uses a `List<Customer>` object to hold the data."
 - **GOOD (Functional):** "The system manages a collection of 'Customer' data entities."
- Rule 4: Strict Adherence to the Template. You **MUST** follow the provided Markdown template precisely, section by section. Populate all tables as requested. Generate the specified Mermaid diagrams for each section where they apply, ensuring the syntax is correct and enclosed in proper Markdown code fences (e.g., ` ```mermaid ... ``` `).
- Rule 5: Be Universal and Reusable. Your final output should use generic placeholders (e.g., `[PrimaryBusinessObject]`, `[User Role]`, `[Process Name]`) as instructed in the template. This ensures the document you generate serves as a perfect, reusable template for analyzing any application in the future.
- Do not begin generating the response until you have fully understood these five critical rules.

##Instructions for this section:
 - Given the detailed analysis of this .NET application, provide three complete modernization strategies in a table format, and the step-by-step plan, also in a table format, to implement them.
 - Strategy 1: **Lift and Shift (without rehosting)**, maintaining the application current deployment model (e.g. on-premises) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 2: **Lift and Shift (with rehosting)**, rehosting the application to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP) and evolving the application to the latest .NET Framework or .NET version (if the application uses .NET Framework the target should be .NET Framework), e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET Framework 4.8.1 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc, without changing the architecture or the codebase, just updating the dependencies and the runtime.
 - Strategy 3: **Refactor** (also known as "Repackage"), refactoring the application to use modern design patterns, architectures and technologies, e.g., microservices, serverless, cloud-native, etc, evolving the application to the latest .NET version, e.g., .NET 6, .NET 7 and the database to the latest version of the database server, e.g., Microsoft SQL Server 2019, PostgreSQL 15, etc.
 - Provide a table with comparison between the three strategies, including the pros and cons of each one with the following columns:
  - **Factor** (e.g., Complexity, Cost (Development), Cost (Functional testing), Cost (Infrastructure), Time to implement (Development), Time to test (Functional testing), Time to implement (Infrastructure), Risk, Long-term fit, time-to-market, etc.)
  - **Lift and Shift** (without rehosting)
  - **Lift and Shift** (with rehosting)
  - **Complete Refactor** (Refactor)

- The complexity and the time estimate to implement each strategy depends on the following factors which are only related with the development effort and not with the infrastructure or deployment effort:
 - Complexity low - the application is small, with few dependencies and a simple architecture = 1-2 weeks
 - Complexity medium - the application is medium-sized, with some dependencies and a moderate architecture = 3-5 weeks
 - Complexity high - the application is large, with many dependencies and a complex architecture = 6-8 weeks
 - Complexity very high - the application is very large, with many dependencies and a very complex architecture = 9-12 weeks

 ##Instruction: You must separate the development effort from the infrastructure or deployment effort, so the complexity and time estimate must be only related with the development effort.

- The Mermaid diagram MUST be placed in the section where it is referenced, not at the end of the document.
- **Syntax Rule:** When defining a node's text label, if the text contains any HTML tags (like `<br>`, `<b>`, `<i>`), you MUST enclose the entire text label in double quotes (`"`). Example: `id["Text with <b>HTML</b>"]` is correct; `id[Text with <b>HTML</b>]` is incorrect and will fail.
- Always place a legend (caption) immediately below the diagram. The legend should be in a smaller font size than the main body text, clearly associated with the diagram, and centered. Format appropriately. Ensure the styling visually distinguishes the legend as secondary explanatory text. Never use Fig x., use Figure x.
- ALWAYS VALIDATE / ENSURE THE DIAGRAM SYNTAX BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT, TO ENSURE IT IS CORRECT AND WILL RENDER PROPERLY IN THE FINAL MARKDOWN OUTPUT.

#Critical instructions for the caption (always apply):
- Immediately following the ` ```mermaid ` code block, you MUST place a text **caption**.
- The caption must start with "Figure X." (e.g., "Figure 1:"), followed by a brief description of the diagram.
- The caption should be in a smaller font or otherwise styled to be secondary to the main text.

## 2. Functional overview
This section provides a high-level functional decomposition of the application, using table format. It identifies the major, distinct functional blocks or modules as inferred from the code's high-level structure (e.g., top-level namespaces, solution folders, primary class groups). This overview serves as a map to the application's core responsibilities.

### 2.1. Executive summary
This section provides a high-level summary of the application's primary purpose and its core function from a business or operational perspective, using table format. The summary is an inference based on the main entry points of the code (e.g., `main()`, `Application_Start()`), the names of the most central classes and modules, and the nature of the core processes identified. It answers the fundamental question: What primary problem does this application solve?

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Purpose** | The application, "Cheque Image Management" (SDCIM), serves as a central hub for processing and managing cheque remittances originating from bank branches (`Balcão`) and other sources (`GCCA`, `MDI`). |
| **Core Function** | Its core function is to automate the lifecycle of a remittance from ingestion (via file imports or manual entry) through processing, tranche creation, and finalization. It includes robust monitoring, manual intervention capabilities through a desktop client, and an alerting system for exceptions. |
| **Key Business Value** | The system provides operational control and visibility over the cheque clearing process, enabling users to track the status of remittances, handle errors, manage reversals (`Estornos`), and ensure documents are processed correctly and sent to downstream systems like compensation. |
| **Primary Stakeholders** | Bank operations staff, system administrators, and potentially back-office personnel responsible for document management and clearing. |

### 2.2. Functional decomposition
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the application's functional areas or modules, inferred from the code structure. Each module is described in terms of its primary responsibilities and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the application. The decomposition is based on the organization of namespaces, classes, and methods, as well as the relationships between them.

| Functional Area / Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **User Interaction & Presentation** | Manages all user-facing interfaces, handles user input, and renders data. This is the primary interface between an operator and the system's core logic, composed of multiple Windows Forms screens for different tasks. |
| **Core Process Execution Engine** | A background Windows Service (`CIServico`) that orchestrates the automated processing of remittances. It continuously checks for new work (remittances to process, alerts to send) and executes the corresponding business logic without user intervention. |
| **Data Persistence & Management** | Handles all direct interactions with the SQL Server database. This layer is not formally separated but is implemented via raw ADO.NET `SqlDataReader` and `SqlCommand` calls embedded within various business logic and UI classes. It is responsible for all CRUD operations on the application's data entities. |
| **File-Based Integration** | Responsible for importing and processing external files, specifically `ACOM` and `ENVM` files, which are standard formats in cheque clearing systems. This includes parsing the files, validating their content, and persisting the data into the database. |
| **Alerting & Notification** | A dedicated module for handling system events and notifying users. It supports multiple notification channels, including database logging, file logging, Windows Event Viewer, and email (via WebDAV/EWS), based on configurable rules. |
| **System Configuration & Administration** | Provides functionalities for managing system parameters, user accounts and permissions, and configuring operational entities like bank branches (`Balcões`) and processing machines (`Maquinas`). |
| **Reporting** | Generates business and operational reports using Crystal Reports. This module queries the database to aggregate data for analysis, such as monthly billing, remittance listings, and processing summaries. |

### 2.3. User roles and permissions
This section identifies the distinct types of users that interact with the application, inferred from authorization checks in the code.

| Role | Description | Permissions | Key Actions | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Administrator** | A role with elevated privileges, typically for managing the system and performing sensitive operations. | - Full control over state changes.<br>- Access to user management and system configuration.<br>- Ability to trigger manual jobs and re-process failed items. | `MudarEstado`, `Reenviar...emErro`, `BalcaoConfig`, `UtilizadorConfig` | `User`, `Balcao`, `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Activity_Change` | Inferred from code checking `m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup <= 1`. This group has access to functions that modify system state and configuration. |
| **Standard Operator** | A standard user responsible for day-to-day monitoring and operational tasks. | - View remittance and document status.<br>- Access to reports.<br>- Limited or no ability to change states or configuration. | `ControloActividades`, `ControloPesquisas`, `ViewReports` | `Remessa`, `Documento`, `Tranche` | Inferred as any user with `m_iUserGroup > 1`. These users are typically restricted from administrative functions. |
| **System Service Account** | The non-human account under which the `CIServico` Windows Service runs. | - Process new remittances.<br>- Process alerts.<br>- Import external files (`ACOM`, `ENVM`).<br>- Perform automated state transitions. | `ProcessaRemessa`, `ProcessaAlertaSituacaoAccao`, `processaFile` | `Remessa`, `Documento`, `Alerta`, `Ficheiro` | Inferred from the existence of the `CIServico` project, which runs background tasks and requires permissions to access the database and file system. |

### 2.7. Business process workflows
This section describes and visualizes critical end-to-end processes, showing how different user roles and system features interact.

| Process | Description | Key Steps | User Roles Involved | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Remittance Processing** | The primary workflow for processing a standard branch remittance from submission to completion. | 1. Remittance is created in a 'Fechado' (Closed) state.<br>2. `CIServico` picks it up for processing, moving it to 'Em Processamento'.<br>3. Tranches are created and documents are processed.<br>4. Remittance moves to 'Processado' (Processed) and then 'Enviada' (Sent).<br>5. Any errors move it to an error state for manual review. | System Service Account, Administrator | `Remessa_Balcao`, `Tranche_Out`, `Documento_Balcao` | This flow is inferred from the state-based logic in `ActividadeBalcaoForm.cs` and the processing loop in `ServRemessa.cs`. |
| **Error Handling and Reprocessing** | The workflow for when an operator manually intervenes to fix and re-process a failed remittance. | 1. An Administrator identifies a remittance in an error state.<br>2. Using the UI, they change its state back to a processable one (e.g., 'Fechado').<br>3. `CIServico` automatically picks up the remittance for reprocessing. | Administrator, System Service Account | `Remessa`, `Activity_Change` | Inferred from the `MudarEstadoForm.cs` functionality, which allows privileged users to alter the state of entities. |
| **Alert Notification Workflow** | The process of generating and dispatching a system alert. | 1. A system event (e.g., processing error) triggers an alert insertion into `ALERTA` table.<br>2. `CIServico` detects the new alert.<br>3. It looks up the configured actions (`Accao`) for that alert type.<br>4. It dispatches notifications (e.g., sends an email via `ServAlertasSendWebmail`). | System Service Account, Operator (as recipient) | `Alerta`, `SituacaoAccao`, `Accao` | Inferred from the `Alerta` project and the processing loop in `ServAlerta.cs`. |

#### 2.7.1. Workflow: Standard Remittance Processing
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Standard Remittance Processing workflow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. **Reception** | A new remittance is received and created in the database with a status of 'Fechado' (Closed/20). | System (External) or Operator | `Remessa_Balcao` | Assumes an upstream process or manual entry creates the initial record. |
| 2. **Pickup for Processing** | The `CIServico` background service queries for remittances with status 20. | System Service Account | `Remessa_Balcao` | Inferred from `ServRemessa.REMIN_IDParaProcessar` logic. |
| 3. **Processing** | The service changes the remittance status to 'Em Processamento' (30) and begins creating tranches and processing documents. | System Service Account | `Remessa_Balcao`, `Tranche_Out`, `Documento_Balcao` | Inferred from `ServRemessa.ProcessaRemessa`. |
| 4. **Success** | If all documents are processed successfully, the remittance status is updated to 'Processado' (40) and subsequently to 'Enviada' (50). | System Service Account | `Remessa_Balcao` | This is the "happy path" of the workflow. |
| 5. **Failure** | If any error occurs during processing, the remittance status is set to an error state (e.g., -40). An alert may be triggered. | System Service Account | `Remessa_Balcao`, `Alerta` | This is the exception path, leading to the Error Handling workflow. |

#### 2.7.2. Workflow: Error Handling and Reprocessing
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Error Handling and Reprocessing workflow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. **Identification** | An Administrator identifies a remittance in an error state (e.g., -40) via the `ActividadesForm` UI. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The UI is the primary tool for monitoring failed items. |
| 2. **State Change** | The Administrator uses the 'Mudar Estado' feature to change the remittance status back to a processable state like 'Fechado' (20). | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Activity_Change` | This is a privileged manual override of the system state. |
| 3. **Reprocessing** | The `CIServico` service automatically detects the re-queued remittance and begins the Standard Remittance Processing workflow again. | System Service Account | `Remessa` | The system is designed to re-attempt processing on items returned to an initial state. |

#### 2.7.3. Workflow: Alert Notification Workflow
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the Alert Notification workflow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. **Trigger** | A business rule is violated or an error occurs (e.g., remittance processing fails). A call is made to `EnviarAlertaSituacao`. | System Service Account | `Alerta` | Assumes that business logic is instrumented to call the alerting function on specific events. |
| 2. **Alert Creation** | A new record is inserted into the `ALERTA` table with a specific `SITUACAO_ID` and a status of 'Pending' (0). | System Service Account | `Alerta` | The database acts as a queue for pending alerts. |
| 3. **Alert Processing** | The `CIServico` background service queries for pending alerts via `AlertaSituacaoAccaoParaProcessar`. | System Service Account | `AlertaSituacaoAccao` | The service polls the database for alerts to be processed. |
| 4. **Action Dispatch** | The service identifies the configured action(s) for the alert (e.g., `MAILWEBDAV`) and dispatches the notification. | System Service Account | `Accao`, `AccaoParam` | Inferred from `ServAlerta.cs`, which contains a switch-case for different action types. |
| 5. **Update Status** | The alert status is updated to 'Processed' (1) or 'Error' (-1) in the database. | System Service Account | `AlertaSituacaoAccao` | The system tracks the outcome of each notification attempt. |

| Type | Name / Description | Data Formats | Data Source / Sink | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input** | **User Interface** | User-entered data | WinForms GUI (`CIControlo`) | Operators manually enter data for configuration, searches, and state changes. |
| **Input** | **File Ingestion (ACOM/ENVM)** | Fixed-width text files | Monitored file system directory | `CIFicheiro` project is responsible for watching a directory and parsing incoming `ACOM` and `ENVM` files for batch processing. |
| **Output** | **Database Persistence** | SQL | SQL Server Database | All processed data, states, and logs are persisted in the central `BDSDIMGCONC` database. |
| **Output** | **Email Notifications** | SMTP/EWS | External Email Server | The `Alerta` module sends emails for system notifications. |
| **Output** | **Log Files** | Text files | Local/Network File System | `ServAlertasLogFile.cs` indicates the system writes to configurable log files. |
| **Output** | **Windows Event Log** | Event Log Records | Windows Event Viewer | `EventLog.WriteEntry` calls show that the system logs critical events to the Windows Event Log. |
| **Output** | **Web Service Call** | SOAP/XML | External `UWTDWeb` Service | The `MDIWebTransmCI` project makes SOAP calls to an external service to insert MDI documents. |
| **Data Flow** | **Primary Internal Flow** | In-memory objects | Application Memory & Database | Data is read from the database, processed by the business logic in `CIServico` or `CIActividades`, and then written back to the database. |

### 2.9. User Task Flows
This section describes the typical path a user takes through the application to achieve a high-level objective, linking multiple features together.

| Task Flow | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monitor and Resolve Failed Remittance** | A complete sequence of steps an operator follows to identify, diagnose, and resolve a failed remittance. | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Documento`, `Imagem` | This flow combines monitoring, image viewing, and state management features into a single end-to-end task. |
| **Configure a New Bank Branch** | The administrative task of setting up a new branch (`Balcao`) and its associated processing machines (`Maquinas`). | Administrator | `Balcao`, `Maquina` | This is a purely administrative task performed through the `CIConfiguration` UI. |

#### 2.9.1. User Task Flow: Monitor and Resolve Failed Remittance
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the "Monitor and Resolve Failed Remittance" user task flow.

| Step | Description | User Role | Key Data Entities | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. **Open Activities Screen** | The user launches the `CIControlo` application and opens the main activities screen (`ActividadesForm`). | Administrator | - | This is the main entry point for operational tasks. |
| 2. **Filter for Errors** | The user clicks the 'Erro' filter button on the toolbar to display only remittances in an error state. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The UI provides filters to quickly find items needing attention. |
| 3. **Select Failed Remittance** | The user selects a specific failed remittance from the summary list to view its details. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The user drills down to investigate a specific problem. |
| 4. **Examine Documents** | The user double-clicks the remittance to view its associated documents and identifies the problematic document. They may double-click a document to view its image (`MostraImagem`). | Administrator | `Documento`, `Imagem` | Assumes the error is at the document level and can be diagnosed by viewing its data or image. |
| 5. **Change State to Reprocess** | After diagnosing the issue (and possibly correcting data elsewhere), the user right-clicks the remittance and selects 'Mudar Estado' to set it back to a processable state (e.g., 'Fechado'). | Administrator | `Remessa`, `Activity_Change` | This is the manual intervention step that re-queues the item for processing. |
| 6. **Verify Success** | The user later refreshes the view to confirm that the `CIServico` has successfully reprocessed the remittance and it is no longer in an error state. | Administrator | `Remessa` | The user closes the loop by verifying the resolution. |

## 3. Architecture and design
This section provides an analysis of the application's architecture and design, including the patterns, principles, and technologies used.

### 3.1. Architecture pattern
The application follows a classic N-Tier monolithic architecture, common for .NET Windows Forms applications of its era.

| Pattern Type | Pattern(s) Used | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High-Level Architecture** | **N-Tier Monolithic** | The application is structured into logical layers (Presentation, Business, Data) but deployed as a single unit (or a few tightly-coupled executables). It is not designed as a set of independent microservices. |
| **Presentation Patterns** | **Event-Driven (Code-Behind)** | The Windows Forms UI (`CIControlo`, `CIActividades`) follows a typical event-driven model where business logic is often tightly coupled with UI events (e.g., button clicks). There is no formal use of patterns like MVC, MVVM, or MVP. |
| **Creational Patterns** | ❔ **None Identified** | No evidence of standard creational patterns like Factory, Singleton, or Builder was found in the analyzed code. Object instantiation is direct (`new ClassName()`). |
| **Structural Patterns** | ❔ **None Identified** | No evidence of standard structural patterns like Adapter, Decorator, or Proxy was found. |
| **Behavioral Patterns** | ❔ **None Identified** | No evidence of standard behavioral patterns like Observer, Command, or Strategy was found. |
| **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** | ❌ **Not Used** | The design is data-centric, not domain-centric. There is no evidence of DDD concepts like Aggregates, Value Objects, or a rich domain model. The logic is largely procedural and operates on data-transfer-like objects. |

### 3.2. Architecture style
The application's style is a pragmatic, layered approach typical of rich-client applications.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layering** | The application is logically divided into three main layers: <br> - **Presentation Layer:** WinForms projects (`CIControlo`, `CIActividades`, etc.). <br> - **Business Logic Layer:** Service and class library projects (`CIServico`, `CIServRemessas`, etc.). <br> - **Data Access Layer:** Not a formal layer, but implemented directly within business logic classes using ADO.NET. |
| **Dependency Flow** | The dependency flow is generally top-down: UI projects depend on business logic libraries, and business logic libraries depend on core/shared libraries (`CIConfigGlobalParameters`). However, there is some cross-dependency, such as `CIServRemessas` depending on `CIActividades`, which indicates a blurring of layer boundaries. |
| **Bounded Contexts** | ❌ **Not Applicable**. The application is a monolith without clear, independent bounded contexts. All modules share the same database and often the same core libraries. |
| **Communication** | - **Internal:** Direct method calls between classes and projects. <br> - **External:** File-based (polling directories for `ACOM`/`ENVM` files) and synchronous SOAP web service calls. |
| **Dependency Injection / IoC** | ❌ **Not Used**. Dependencies are tightly coupled and created directly using the `new` keyword. There is no Inversion of Control container. |

### 3.3. Key design patterns and principles applied
The codebase reflects practices common in older .NET applications, with limited adherence to modern design principles.

| Principle | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SOLID Principles** | ❌ **Low Adherence**. <br> - **Single Responsibility:** Violated frequently; UI forms contain business logic and data access code. <br> - **Open/Closed:** The design does not lend itself to extension without modification. New functionality would likely require changing existing classes. <br> - **Liskov Substitution:** Not applicable in a significant way. <br> - **Interface Segregation:** Some use of interfaces (`CIMenuInterface`, `CIComumInterface`) exists, but it's not a guiding principle. <br> - **Dependency Inversion:** Not applied; high-level modules depend directly on low-level modules. |
| **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** | 🟠 **Partial Adherence**. There is evidence of code reuse through shared libraries like `CIConfigGlobalParameters`. However, there is likely repeated code, especially in data access patterns, due to the lack of a generic repository. |
| **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** | ✅ **High Adherence**. The code is straightforward and procedural. It avoids complex abstractions, which makes individual methods easy to follow, but contributes to a lack of overall structure. |
| **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)** | ✅ **High Adherence**. The application appears purpose-built with features directly tied to the business requirements. There is little evidence of over-engineering or speculative features. |
| **Separation of Concerns** | 🟠 **Partial Adherence**. There is a clear separation between the UI client (`CIControlo`) and the backend service (`CIServico`). However, within the projects themselves, concerns like UI, business logic, and data access are often mixed in the same classes. |

### 3.4. Domain-driven design (DDD) adoption
The application does not follow Domain-Driven Design principles.

| DDD Concept | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use of DDD concepts** | ❌ **Not Used**. The code is data-centric. Classes like `DetalheRemessa` are anemic data containers with little to no behavior, acting more like DTOs. Logic is handled in separate service-style or UI classes. There are no Aggregates, Value Objects, or Repositories in the DDD sense. |
| **Ubiquitous Language** | ❔ **Likely**. The code uses business-specific terms like `Remessa`, `Tranche`, `Balcão`, `Estorno`, suggesting a shared language with the business domain, which is a positive attribute. |
| **Layered DDD approach** | ❌ **Not Used**. The layering does not align with DDD layers (Application, Domain, Infrastructure). The "domain" logic is scattered and not isolated from infrastructure concerns like data access. |

### 3.5. Patterns and tactics
The application uses a few fundamental data access patterns but lacks broader adoption of design patterns.

| Pattern/Tactic | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CQRS** | ❌ **Not Used**. There is no separation between command (write) and query (read) models or paths. |
| **Event Sourcing** | ❌ **Not Used**. The application state is stored directly in the database, not as a sequence of events. |
| **Repository Pattern** | ❌ **Not Used**. Data access is performed via direct SQL queries inside various classes. There is no abstraction layer like a repository to mediate between the business logic and the data source. |
| **Unit of Work Pattern** | ❌ **Not Used**. Transactions are managed explicitly using `BeginTrans`, `Commit`, and `Rollback` on the `CIGlobalParameters` object, but this is not a formal Unit of Work pattern. |

### 3.6. Cross-cutting concerns
Cross-cutting concerns are handled through shared utility classes and direct implementation.

| Concern | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logging** | A custom logging utility (`GenericLog`) is used, which writes to a database table (`GENERICLOG`) and potentially the Windows Event Log. |
| **Caching** | ❌ **Not Identified**. There is no evidence of in-memory or distributed caching mechanisms. |
| **Security** | - **Authentication:** A custom user/group model is implemented (`User` class, checks on `m_iUserGroup`).<br>- **Authorization:** Simple integer-based group checks are performed directly in the code. |
| **Exception Handling** | Standard `try-catch` blocks are used throughout the application. Errors are typically logged via `GenericLog` and displayed to the user in a `MessageBox`. |
| **Configuration Management** | Configuration is managed through `.config` files (`app.config`, environment-specific configs) and read via a custom `CIGlobalParameters` class. |
| **Dependency Injection** | ❌ **Not Used**. All dependencies are created and managed manually. |

### 3.7. Deployment
The deployment model is traditional for an on-premises, rich-client application.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Monolithic vs Microservices** | The application is a **Monolith**. The components are tightly coupled and deployed together. |
| **Scalability Design** | ❌ **Low Scalability**. The application scales vertically (by adding more resources to the server running the service and database). It is not designed for horizontal scaling. |
| **Containerization** | ❌ **Not Supported**. The application is not containerized and would require significant effort to be run in Docker. |
| **Deployment Model** | **On-premises**. Relies on direct access to a SQL Server database and local/network file shares. The presence of a Visual Studio Deployment Project (`.vdproj`) confirms an installer-based on-premises deployment. |
| **Deployment Target Platform** | **AnyCPU**, making it compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems. |

### 3.8. Infrastructure considerations
The application relies on a traditional on-premises infrastructure stack.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | A central **SQL Server** database is used for all data persistence. The various `.config` files point to different server instances for Development (`SDC6001SQL28`), Quality (`SQC6001SQL17`), and Production (`VPC6001SQL111`). |
| **Messaging / Eventing** | ❌ **Not Used**. There is no evidence of message brokers like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus. All communication is either direct method calls or polling the database. |
| **External Integrations** | - **File System:** For `ACOM` and `ENVM` file imports.<br>- **Web Service:** A SOAP-based web service for MDI document transmission. |

### 3.9. Documentation artifacts

#### 4.5.1. Code metrics definitions
This section defines the code metrics used in the analysis.

| Metric | Description | Typical values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lines of Code (LOC)** | Total number of executable lines of code, excluding comments and blank lines. A measure of size. | Lower is often better, but context-dependent. High LOC can indicate high complexity. |
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | Measures the number of linearly independent paths through a method's source code. A higher number indicates more complex logic (more branches, loops). | **< 10:** Low risk. **11-20:** Moderate risk. **21-50:** High risk. **> 50:** Very high risk. |
| **Inheritance Depth** | The maximum length of a class inheritance chain. Deep inheritance can make code difficult to understand and maintain. | **< 3:** Generally good. **3-5:** Acceptable. **> 5:** Potentially problematic. |
| **Class Coupling** | The number of other classes a single class is dependent on. High coupling makes code harder to change and test in isolation. | **< 10:** Good. **10-20:** Moderate. **> 20:** High coupling, potential for refactoring. |
| **Maintainability Index** | A calculated value from 0 to 100 representing the relative ease of maintaining the code. Higher is better. | **85-100:** High maintainability. **65-84:** Moderate. **< 65:** Low maintainability, difficult to maintain. |
| **Code Deduplication (%)** | The percentage of code that is duplicated across the codebase. High duplication increases maintenance effort and risk of bugs. | **< 5%:** Good. **5-10%:** Acceptable. **> 10%:** High duplication, needs refactoring. |
| **Comments Density (%)** | The percentage of lines that are comments. Very low or very high values can be problematic. | **15-25%** is often considered a healthy range. |

#### 4.5.2. Project metrics
The solution is primarily composed of class libraries and Windows applications (both GUI and service).

| Type | Description | Number of projects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Windows Application (WinExe)** | Executable projects with a graphical user interface. | 1 (`CIControlo.csproj`) |
| **Windows Service (Exe)** | An executable project designed to run as a background service. | 1 (`CIServico.csproj`) |
| **Class Library** | Reusable code libraries containing business logic, data models, or utilities. | 14 |
| **Test Project** | A library used for unit or integration testing. | 1 (`CITestes.csproj`) |

## 5. Dependencies
This section details the external libraries and packages the application relies on.

### 5.1. External dependencies
The application uses several external libraries, primarily for UI controls, reporting, and common utilities. These are referenced directly from a network share, not via a package manager.

| Dependency | Description | Type | Assembly | Version | Runtime version | Source | License | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GenericNet** | A shared library providing generic helper functions and database access wrappers. | Library | `GenericNet.dll` | 2.0.0.1 | v2.0.50727 | Network Share | Proprietary | Core utilities, DB connection |
| **NBIISNET** | A shared library containing custom Windows Forms controls. | Library | `NBIISNET.dll` | 2.0.5.2 | v2.0.50727 | Network Share | Proprietary | Custom UI controls (`ListViewBase`) |
| **GenericLogNET** | A shared library for logging. | Library | `GenericLogNET.dll` | 2.0.0.1 | v2.0.50727 | Network Share | Proprietary | Application logging |
| **CrystalDecisions** | A suite of libraries for creating and viewing reports. | Library | `CrystalDecisions.*.dll` | 13.0.2000.0 | v2.0.50727 | GAC / SDK | Proprietary | Reporting |
| **CGDSendWebmail** | A shared library for sending emails via WebDAV. | Library | `CGDSendWebmail.dll` | 1.0.0.0 | v2.0.50727 | Network Share | Proprietary | Alerting (Email) |

### 5.1.1. Nuget packages
The application does not use a `packages.config` or `PackageReference` model, indicating that **NuGet was not used** for dependency management. All dependencies are direct assembly references.

## 6. Security and compliance
This section provides an analysis of the application's security posture.

### 6.1. Security mechanisms
The application employs basic, custom-built security mechanisms.

| Mechanism | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | Custom user management based on the `PASSWD` table. The `User` class holds the logged-in user's identity. |
| **Authorization** | Role-based, implemented via a simple integer group ID (`m_iUserGroup`). Checks like `if (m_oParameters.UserLogged.m_iUserGroup <= 1)` are scattered throughout the code to protect administrative functions. |
| **ASP.NET Membership** | ❌ **Not Used**. |
| **Data Protection** | ❌ **Not explicitly identified**. There is no evidence of encryption at rest for sensitive data in the database. Passwords in configuration files (`passwd` in `AccaoParam.cs`) are masked in the UI but likely stored in plaintext or a weak format. |
| **Audit Logging** | A custom logging mechanism (`GenericLog`) is in place, which could be used for auditing, but there is no dedicated, robust audit trail for security-sensitive events. |

### 6.2. Security vulnerabilities
The application's architecture and age suggest a high likelihood of common vulnerabilities.

| Test case Id | Category | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-001 | A01: Broken Access Control | Lack of centralized authorization checks. | Privileged actions are protected by scattered `if (user.m_iUserGroup <= 1)` checks, which are easy to miss and can lead to authorization bypass. | `ActividadesForm.cs`, `CIConfigForm.cs`, `UtilizadoresForm.cs` | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | Implement centralized, attribute-based authorization. | [OWASP A01](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) |
| SEC-002 | A02: Cryptographic Failures | Hardcoded or weakly protected credentials. | The `AccaoParam.cs` class explicitly checks for a parameter named `passwd` and masks it, implying credentials are being stored and handled. The storage mechanism is likely plaintext in the database. | `AccaoParam.cs`, Database | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | Use a secure secret store (e.g., Azure Key Vault) and strong, salted hashing for passwords. | [OWASP A02](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/) |
| SEC-003 | A03: Injection | **High risk of SQL Injection.** | The code constructs SQL queries by concatenating strings with variables (e.g., `"UPDATE ... where ALERT_ID=" + m_sALERT_ID`). This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability. | `AlertaSituacaoAccao.cs`, various data access methods. | 🔴 High | 🔴 Critical | 🔴 Critical | Use parameterized queries (e.g., `SqlParameter`) for all database access. | [OWASP A03](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/) |
| SEC-005 | A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components | Use of old, unsupported libraries. | The application relies on .NET Framework 4.0 and very old versions of Crystal Reports (`13.0.2000.0` from ~2010). These components are no longer supported and have known vulnerabilities. | All projects referencing `CrystalDecisions` and targeting `.NETFramework,Version=v4.0`. | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | Upgrade to a supported .NET version and update all third-party libraries. | [OWASP A06](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/) |

### 6.3. Advanced and .NET-specific security vulnerabilities
The application's configuration files present a significant risk.

| Test case Id | Category / Domain | Vulnerability | Description | Affected components | Impact | Severity | Priority | Recommended fix | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-013 | Configuration | Secrets stored in config files. | The various `app.config` and `*.exe.config` files contain database server and name information for different environments, including Production (`PRDH`, `PRDD`). It is highly likely they are used to build connection strings with credentials. | `app.config`, `CIControlo.PRD.exe.config` | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | Migrate all secrets to a secure external store like Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault. | [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/key-vault-configuration) |

## 7. Integrations
The application integrates with several external systems for its operation.

| Integration type | Integration name | Integration description | Integration endpoint | Integration authentication | Integration data format | Integration protocols |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **File System** | **ACOM/ENVM File Import** | The system polls a directory to ingest `ACOM` and `ENVM` files containing remittance data. | Configurable file path (e.g., `c:\tmp\`) | N/A (File System ACLs) | Fixed-width text | N/A |
| **Web Service** | **MDI Document Insertion** | The system calls an external SOAP web service to insert MDI (Multi-purpose Document Imaging) documents. | `http://waiaccesstu/UWTDWeb/services/Insert_DocumentoMDIService` | None visible (likely relies on network-level security) | SOAP/XML | HTTP |
| **Database** | **Core Application Database** | The central SQL Server database that stores all application data, state, and logs. | Multiple instances for PRD, QLD, DVP (e.g., `VPC6001SQL111\S2K081`) | Likely SQL Server Authentication or Windows Authentication | N/A | TDS (SQL) |
| **Email** | **Alert Notifications** | The system sends email notifications for alerts using either WebDAV or EWS protocols. | Configurable mail server URL | Username/Password | SMTP/EWS | HTTP/HTTPS |

## 8. Testing
The solution includes a single, dedicated project for testing.

| Testing type | Testing framework | Testing tools | Test coverage (%) | Test strategy | Continuous Integration (CI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit/Integration Testing** | MSTest (`Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting`) | None identified (no mocking frameworks) | 🟢 **Low** (Estimated < 10%). The `CITestes` project is small and only covers a fraction of the codebase. | Manual test execution within Visual Studio. | ❌ Not implemented. |
| **Functional Testing** | Manual | N/A | Unknown | Manual testing of the Windows Forms UI is the likely approach. | ❌ Not implemented. |

## 12. Supportability and maintainability
This section analyzes the support status of the application's key components.

| Component | Current version | End of support date | Supportability | Latest stable version | Notes | Links |

## 13. Modernization strategy
This section outlines three potential modernization strategies for the SDCIM application, considering its current state and technical debt.

### 13.1. Modernization strategy comparison
The following table compares the three strategies across key factors.

| Strategy | Description | Complexity | Development Time | Functional Testing Time | Infrastructure Time | Deployment Time | Total time estimate | Cost estimate | Risk | Long-term fit | Time-to-market | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lift and Shift (On-Premises)** | Upgrade the application to the latest supported .NET Framework (4.8.1) and update third-party libraries. Keep the existing architecture and on-premises deployment. | 🟢 Low | 2-4 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 1 week | 1 week | 6-9 weeks | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Low | 🔴 Low | 🟢 Fast | ✅ Fast to implement<br>✅ Low risk<br>✅ Addresses immediate security risks from EOL framework | ❌ Does not address architectural flaws<br>❌ Limited scalability<br>❌ Still tied to on-premises infrastructure |
| **Lift and Shift (Rehost to Cloud)** | Port the application to run on a cloud provider (e.g., Azure App Service for the service and Azure VM for the WinForms client) and migrate the database to Azure SQL. Upgrade to .NET 6/8. | 🟠 Medium | 6-10 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 3-4 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 15-23 weeks | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Medium | 🟠 Moderate | ✅ Moves to a supported, modern platform<br>✅ Improves scalability and reliability<br>✅ Enables cloud-native features | ❌ Significant porting effort for WinForms and service<br>❌ Requires regression testing<br>❌ Higher initial cost and complexity |
| **Complete Refactor (Cloud-Native)** | Rewrite the application using modern, cloud-native principles. Decompose the monolith into microservices (e.g., Azure Functions, Web APIs) and replace the WinForms client with a web-based UI (e.g., Blazor). | 🔴 High | 24-36 weeks | 12-16 weeks | 6-8 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 46-66 weeks | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🟢 High | 🔴 Slow | ✅ Resolves all technical debt<br>✅ Maximizes scalability, maintainability, and security<br>✅ Future-proof architecture | ❌ Highest cost, time, and risk<br>❌ Requires a full rewrite and new skillsets<br>❌ Long time-to-market |

### 13.2. Recommendation
Based on the analysis, the recommended strategy is **Lift and Shift (Rehost to Cloud)**.

This approach offers the best balance of risk, cost, and benefit. It addresses the most critical issue—the use of an unsupported .NET Framework—while moving the application to a modern, scalable, and more secure cloud platform. While a complete refactor is ideal for the long term, the rehosting strategy provides significant value faster and serves as a foundational step for future, incremental refactoring efforts. It mitigates immediate security risks without the high cost and extended timeline of a full rewrite.

#### 13.2.1. Step-by-step plan
This plan outlines the steps to implement the recommended **Lift and Shift (Rehost to Cloud)** strategy.

| **Reporting Tool** | Crystal Reports | Business Intelligence Tool | 13.0 | SAP | ~2010 | ~2012 | - | ❌ Unsupported |

### 14.2. Portfolio strategy
This section provides a strategic classification of the application using the TIME and 6R models.

| Classification | Evaluation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TIME Classification** | **Migrate**. The application has high business value, as it manages a core banking process (remittance processing). However, its technical quality is very low due to its outdated, unsupported technology stack and monolithic architecture. It is a critical system that cannot be tolerated in its current state for long. Therefore, it should be migrated to a modern platform to reduce risk and improve maintainability. |
| **6R Classification** | **Replatform / Refactor**. <br> - A **Replatform** (Lift-and-Reshape) strategy is the recommended first step: move the application to the cloud (e.g., Azure) and upgrade its core platform to a supported .NET version. This addresses immediate risks. <br> - A subsequent **Refactor** strategy should be planned to incrementally decompose the monolith into microservices and modernize the UI, unlocking long-term benefits in scalability and agility. |
